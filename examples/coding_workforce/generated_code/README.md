# Generated Code

This directory contains code generated by the Coding Workforce example.

Each project is stored in a separate subdirectory with the format:
`[project_name]_[timestamp]/`

## Project Structure

Each generated project follows this structure:

```
[project_name]_[timestamp]/
├── backend/                    # FastAPI backend application
├── frontend/                   # React frontend application
├── infrastructure/             # AWS CDK infrastructure code
├── docs/                       # Project documentation
└── README.md                   # Project overview
```

## Usage

To use a generated project:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Follow the instructions in the project's README.md file
3. Install dependencies for backend and frontend
4. Run the application locally or deploy to AWS

## Human Approval

Some operations, like Git pushes and AWS deployments, require human approval.
