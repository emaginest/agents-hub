                Referral to Mental Health Professionals: If a client exhibits signs of severe anxiety, depression, or other mental health challenges, have a list of trusted mental health professionals ready for referral. Ensure clients feel comfortable and supported in seeking additional help when necessary.

        Honoring Diverse Backgrounds:

                Cultural Competence Training: Continuously educate yourself on different cultural practices, beliefs, and traditions related to pregnancy and childbirth. Use this knowledge to provide care that respects each client’s cultural background.
                Personalized Care Approaches: During the initial consultation, discuss the client’s cultural preferences, religious beliefs, and any specific practices they wish to incorporate into their pregnancy journey. Adjust your care plan to honor these preferences.
        
        Inclusive and Respectful Support:
